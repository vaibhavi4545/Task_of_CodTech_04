## Overview of the Project
**Project Overview: Generative Text Model**

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to create a text generation model capable of producing coherent paragraphs on specific topics. This involves implementing a model using GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, with the development carried out in the VS Code editor. The project emphasizes practical understanding and application of deep learning for natural language processing (NLP).

**Key Components**
1) Dataset:

I) A high-quality text corpus relevant to the desired topics for training the model.
II) Example datasets: WikiText, Project Gutenberg books, or custom datasets relevant to specific topics.
2) Model Architecture:

I) GPT (Transformer-based):
Leverages the Transformer architecture with self-attention mechanisms for efficient context understanding and long-range dependencies.
II) LSTM (RNN-based):
Uses a sequential learning approach to model text generation, capturing temporal dependencies in the text.
3) Output:

The model generates coherent paragraphs or responses on specific topics based on given prompts.

**Learning Outcomes**
I) Understanding of key NLP techniques and architectures (Transformers or LSTMs).
II) Practical experience with model training and fine-tuning using large text datasets.
III) Knowledge of text generation applications and techniques for evaluating language models.
IV) Hands-on experience in deploying AI models for real-world use.

**Result**
The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
Once upon a time in a distant galaxy, the galaxy was a vast, vast and vast galaxy. It was the center of the universe, and the stars were the only stars that could be seen. The stars of this galaxy were known as the "Stars of Death".

The stars in this universe were called the Stars of Life. They were not the same as those in the past, but they were different.
